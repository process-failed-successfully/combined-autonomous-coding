            Analyze the repository to understand its purpose and active components.
            Identify ONE missing but high-value feature or improvement (e.g., CLI usability, new subcommand, better error handling).

            YOUR GOAL:
            1. Propose and implement this 1 useful feature.
            2. You MUST add strong testing (unit or integration) to verify it.

            Constraints:
            - Do not break existing tests.
            - Do not just do "cleanup" or "documentation" unless it is critical. Focus on functional value.
